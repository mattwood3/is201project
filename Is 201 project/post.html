                        <p>Italian food is amongst the best on the planet. Italy hasn't gone far from the rich history in food. I have traveled to Italy many times and I am honest when I say that I have never been dissatisfied with a meal. With simple and authentic ingredients to each meal, here are some of the best experiences I have had with the food.</p>
                        <p>My parents live in Italy, so I will be visiting the country a lot more in the future. The most recent time I visited them in Italy, we decided to make a note on our phones of the best restaurants and in what cities they were in so that in the future, we know exactly where we can get the best food when traveling to a specific city.</p>
                        <p>What I wasn't expecting was that it was harder to decide on my favorite places to eat because every place we ate at had amazing food.</p>
                        <p>The freshness of the food in Italy sets it apart. It seemed as if in every marinara sauce the tomatoes were just picked, or in any salad the ingredients were straight from the garden out back. This played a big part into my belief that Italian food is the best food on the planet.</p>
                        <p>For those who haven't been to Italy yet and are planning on going, prepare to be amazed by not just the amazing sites you will see, but the food that you will taste. I am sure that you will leave Italy with a satisfied apetite and thinking similarily as me.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The facts behind the food</h2>
                        <p>First of all, pizza was invented in Naples, Italy. I thought American pizza was good until I realized that there is pizza that melts in your mouth. That is Italian pizza.</p>
                        <p>Second, there are more than 350 types of pasta and the average Italian eats pasta once a day! That is a whole lot of pasta. However, you won't find yourself getting sick of this as you will find that every pasta dish is very unique.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Each region of Italy has its own favorite way of eating pasta and Italy produces 3 tons of pasta each year.</blockquote>
                        <p>Italian cheese has the richest varieties in the world with over 400 creations. The cheese is so specific that each has a different consistency. One thing you can count on in grocery stores in Italy is isles upon isles of cheese.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Surprises and what you should be prepared for</h2>
                        <p>The biggest surprise to me about Italian food is that breakfast is not a big deal at all. First, because the other meals of the day are heavy meals and second because they don't have many options for breakfast. Breakfast in the morning for me was usually melon with prosciutto or a croissant.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/pizza.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">To go to places you have never been before and eat food you have never eaten before – that’s what living is all about.</span>
                        <p>Meal times for me were an adjustment also. I am used to eating breakfast at around 9, lunch at 12, and dinner at around 5. In Italy, breakfast is usually right as you get up, lunch in between 12:30 and 2, an afternoon snack between 4 and 5, and dinner in between 7 and 8:30.</p>
                        <p>Meals are much bigger in Italy than in the United States. A full meal contains and appetizer, first course and a second course with a side dish. These meals usually last longer than an hour and a half. The culture there is very meal driven.</p>
                        <p>In summary, embracing the Italian culture of food was one of the best decisions I made as I was in Italy. I am now a true believer in the food and dream of the day that I can go back and eat a fresh pizza.</p>
